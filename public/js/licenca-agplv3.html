        <h1>GNU Affero General Public License v3</h1>
        <h3>Version 3, 19 November 2007</h3>
        <p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p> The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
            software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
            cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</p>
        <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
            to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
            our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
            share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
            software for all its users.</p>
        <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
            price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
            have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
            them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
            want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
            free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
        <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
            with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
            you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
            and/or modify the software.</p>       
        <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
            improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
            receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
            incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
            encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
            software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
            The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
            letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
            source code to the public.</p>
        <p> The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
            ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
            to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
            provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
            users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
            a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
            code of the modified version.</p>
        <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
            published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
            a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
            released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
            this license.</p>
        <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
            modification follow.</p>

        <h2>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2>
        <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms...</p>
